1. Place yourself immediately after and event
has occurred and compute the new populations.

2. Compute R = 􏰀α Wα(X). Generate an exponentially
distributed time T for the next event, with parameter R.
3. Generate a uniformly distributed 
number s in [0,R] and pick which event
has occurred as follows: if 􏰀β−1 Wα(X) ≤ s < 􏰀β Wα(X) we
say that event β has occurred.
4. Update Time, events and populations,
and repeat the process.
